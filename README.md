This project is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed as part of a B.Tech final year project. The IDS is designed to identify and classify network intrusions using Deep Learning techniques, specifically leveraging XLSTM (Extended Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

Features: Utilizes XLSTM to detect various types of network intrusions with high accuracy. Capable of processing large-scale network traffic data. Implements a hybrid approach combining feature extraction and deep learning classification. Supports multiple types of attacks, including DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R. Trained and tested using datasets like KDD Cup 99 or NSL-KDD.

Technologies: Python for development TensorFlow or PyTorch for building the XLSTM model Pandas and NumPy for data handling Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizing results

Goals: The goal of this project is to develop an effective IDS that can enhance network security by detecting and preventing unauthorized access or attacks in real time.
